# Image and Video Processing: Spatial filtering and Processing
As part of my bachelors degree, I had a course Image and Video Processing. 
This repository is one of the projects I had to complete for the course.

Several image processing techniques are applied to different images. These techniques include:
1. Image degradation
2. Watermark insertion
3. Watermark detection
4. Morphology
5. Granulometry
6. PCA - Recognition


I completed this assignment and achieved 90%.
